          Every human interaction is an opportunity to learn. It's also an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and expertise in a
          specific context and capacity. We view every professional interaction as a high-stakes game - whether you are likely to save
          money, generate revenue, make a process more efficient or improve your performance. These virtual interactions act as practice
          sessions where you can test drive real-world interactions. Experts in the world may differ on what skills matter - but they are
          all have a common point of view. Practice is the key to improvement â€“ and specific feedback makes improvement faster.
